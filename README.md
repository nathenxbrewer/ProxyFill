A web app for automating printing PKMN proxy cards using DriveThruCards.
This app is in beta so expect some potential bugs. Check the Releases for the desktop companion app. 

> **Note**
>The companion app only downloads images at this time. I am still working on the DTC automation. Please reach out if you have Selenium experience.

App is hosted via Github Pages <a href="https://nathenxbrewer.github.io/ProxyFill/" target="_blank">Here</a>

### Planned Features
